# Questions

Here are 2 questions related to the codebase. There's no right or wrong answer - we want to understand your reasoning.

## Question 1: API Specification Approaches

When it comes to API spec and endpoints handlers, we have an Open API yaml file for the `Warehouse` API from which we generate code, but for the other endpoints - `Product` and `Store` - we just coded everything directly. 

What are your thoughts on the pros and cons of each approach? Which would you choose and why?
